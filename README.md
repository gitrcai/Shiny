# This is the Shiny Application and Reprodcible Pitch Project. 

I include ui.R and server.R which produce my Shiny application I posted on https://rcai.shinyapps.io/myApp/. I also include App_Project.Rmd which produce my presentation resulting App_Project.html. Since Shiny can not supported in static R Markdown documentation. I also posted the presentation on https://rcai.shinyapps.io/App_Project/#5Â .
